# Data LLM

This directory contains code to train, evaluate and run inference on LLMs
integrated with Data Commons.

It also includes a python called `data_gemma` that can be used for doing
inference with the Gemma 2 (or other) LLMs fine-tuned for integration with Data
Commons.

## Install `data_gemma`

```
pip install data_gemma@git+https://github.com/datacommonsorg/tools#subdirectory=llm
