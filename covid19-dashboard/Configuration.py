# A dictionary of stat_vars where place_type->key->stat_var.
# There must be at least one stat_var per place_type.
# The key can be made up, this key will be used to output the data.
# Instead of using the long stat_var name.
# The key will be used to identify the stat_var.

# Data is broken down by place_type -> key -> DC statistical variable.
# The statistical variable is never used or referred throughout the app, only the key is.
# The key replaces the statistical variable throughout the dashboard.
