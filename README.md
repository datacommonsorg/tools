# Data Commons Tools

This is a collaborative repository for developing tools on top of Data Commons
[APIs](http://docs.datacommons.org/api/). Such tools may include visualization
widgets, algorithms for detecting anomalous data, and more.

## About Data Commons

[Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) is an Open Knowledge Graph that
provides a unified view across multiple public data sets and statistics.
We've bootstrapped the graph with lots of
[data](https://datacommons.org/datasets) from US Census, CDC, NOAA, etc.,
and through collaborations with the New York Botanical Garden,
Opportunity Insights, and more. However, Data Commons is
meant to be for community, by the community. We're excited to work with you
to make public data accessible to everyone.

To see the extent of data we have today, browse the graph using our
[browser](https://browser.datacommons.org/).
